## To-Do's

### Core
- [ ] Only index.html pages will load (most dApps are good), considering a solution to this, but yeah many options...

### Input (NODE)
- [ ] Human-readable domain names for nodes
- [x] "Apply Node" updates Gnomon --daemon-rpc-address=<127.0.0.1:10102>
- [ ] Show last set/saved node address
- [ ] Gnomon restart on Apply (for now start manually)

### Input (SCID)
- [ ] Special characters in the SCID and Node entry won't bookmark, no need for but yeah UX

### Tabs
- [ ] Live tab title updates when not resolved
- [ ] Allows users to rearrange tabs

### Search
- [ ] Startpage refresh on Gnomon start

### Setting Manager
- [x] Settings Manager Menu
- [x] Light/Dark/System
- [ ] Start/Stop/Autostart TELA-Server 

### Gnomon Manager
- [x] Gnomon Manager Menu
- [x] Gnomon alive/ready indicator
- [x] Start/Stop Gnomon
- [ ] Autostart Gnomon
- [ ] Startpage refresh on Gnomon start
- [ ] Display getInfo
- [ ] Saved Live Logs on page change/refresh

### Readme Page
- [ ] How to run you own node Guide
- [ ] Where to find remote nodes

### Search
- [ ] Ratings filter

### User experience
- [ ] Sidebar collapse when pointer leaves, closes onClick somewhere outside sidebar
- [ ] Readme
- [ ] Not all dApps align good in the browserview, it works but need perfection
- [ ] With really big dApps there isn't a instant page view (I mean more than 3/4 sec) UX solution is showing what is going on in the background or an animation.
- [ ] Consistent interface
