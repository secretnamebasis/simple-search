## Usage

- New blank tab opens the search Page

## To-Do's

### Core
- [ ] Only index.html pages will load (most dApps ar good), considering a solution to this, but yeah many options..
- [ ] Sidebar collapse when pointer leaves, closes onClick somewhere outside sidebar
- [ ] Gnomon settings menu + Gnomon alive/ready indicator
- [ ] Autostart tela-server and Gnomon 
- [ ] Human-readable domain names for nodes
- [ ] Live tab title updates when not resolved

### Search
- [ ] Ratings filter

### User experience
- [ ] Special characters in the SCID and Node entry won't bookmark, no need for but yeah UX
- [ ] Not all dApps align good in the browserview, it works but need perfection
- [ ] Re-write color schemes so that dark/light/system mode works 
- [ ] With really big dApps there isn't a instant page view (I mean more than 3/4 sec) UX solution is showing what is going on in the background or an animation.
- [ ] Consistent interface
